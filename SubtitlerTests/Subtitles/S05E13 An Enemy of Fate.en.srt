1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,000
...

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,491
Previously on Fringe:

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,447
No, no, no. No, it can't be.
Not again.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,527
If we can send the boy
into the future, they'll realize all that he is...

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,724
-...and never go down that path.
- Observers will never exist.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,331
They will never invade.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,764
- Michael is how we're gonna see Etta again.
- We've still got a long way to go.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,771
These things we've collected,
how can they be used to defeat the Observers?

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,361
They are part of a device
that we must build.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,886
There's something I need you to do.

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,564
This is the trigger I need.

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,401
It's an initiating reactor.

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,046
It's lost its charge.

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,084
Without this piece, I cannot reset time.

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,041
If your plan is successful,
we will cease to exist.

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,406
If our plan doesn't succeed,
they will cease to exist.

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,604
After all this time,
the feelings you had for these people...

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,326
...the feelings we all had...

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,849
...they have not grown in you?

20
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,451
When we first came...

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,200
...when we started to experience
emotive development by being in this era...

22
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,840
...we agreed, the 12 of us,
to speak nothing of it.

23
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,890
You lost control, as did August.

24
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,929
When we first came here, we did not know
the true nature of our expedition.

25
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,885
We were not told.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,731
The people of this era...

27
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,687
...this is their destiny.

28
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,210
Destiny can be changed...

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,086
...but you have to have
the will to change it...

30
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,324
...even if it requires sacrifice.

31
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,763
I took a risk even coming to see you...

32
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:49,000
...because I believe that the people
of this era are worth saving.

33
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,171
It needs to be at a 22 degree angle.

34
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,926
Twenty-two degrees. Can you hear me?

35
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,887
Blasted thing. What I wouldn't give for an
old-fashioned tumor-inducing cell phone.

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,243
I can hear you. Twenty-two degrees.
Copy that.

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,444
And make sure it's on an even plane.
Absolutely crucial.

38
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,571
Okay. Stop.

39
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,201
- We're there.
- What's the energy meter reading?

40
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,005
Do you see a red light on?

41
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,362
- Hello.
- It's me. Where are you?

42
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,324
We have the boy. We're on our way.

43
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,568
Once news starts breaking,
I wanna be out.

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,087
I'm gonna get a few things we need
and come to you.

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,725
Good enough. We'll speak soon.

46
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,325
Where are you right now?

47
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,807
We have the boy. We're on our way.

48
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,444
We have the boy. We're on our way.

49
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,802
Once news starts breaking,
I wanna be out.

50
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,004
I'm gonna get a few things we'll need
and come directly to you.

51
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,486
- Here you are, sir. The checkpoints.
- Thank you, Carol. I, um...

52
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,686
I'll be gone for the rest of the afternoon.

53
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,801
Agent Broyles. I would like a word with you.

54
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,601
You are aware we had a level one
security breach today...

55
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,850
...resulting in the abduction of a high-value
detainee from our facility.

56
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,608
No. No, I didn't know that.

57
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,129
The fugitives knew precisely where
we were holding the prisoner.

58
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,527
You think that information came
from someone in my division?

59
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,362
We are exploring all possibilities.

60
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,006
I have heard...

61
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,407
...whispers...

62
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,491
...that the resistance operative
known as The Dove may be among us.

63
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,085
If that were true, whoever it is
should have been read and exposed long ago.

64
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,807
I do not wish to keep you
any longer from your duties.

65
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,568
Remain vigilant, Phillip.

66
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,048
Where have you been?

67
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,767
Why would he step off the monorail?

68
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,769
Why would he do that?

69
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,244
He knows too much. He must have known
that they wanted to harm him.

70
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,122
Apparently there was a reason.

71
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,687
There always is.

72
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,528
I've spoken to Anil and his men.

73
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,405
The magnet has been positioned
on the truck as requested.

74
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,130
We're missing an important part.

75
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,209
The initiating reactor's core decayed
substantially over the past 20 years.

76
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,443
I enlisted help to secure another one.

77
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,802
- From my time.
- An Observer?

78
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,044
One I trust.

79
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,084
But one of you will need to retrieve it.

80
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,123
So, what is the initiating reactor?

81
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,802
It provides a surge of energy
to start up the device.

82
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,323
The purpose of this machine
is to generate a singularity.

83
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,004
Essentially a small Wormhole.

84
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,850
Once it's open,
then we'll be able to deploy the cylinders.

85
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,850
They serve to stabilize each end.

86
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,691
One will remain here, in our present,
as an anchor.

87
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,647
The other one will be sent to
2167.

88
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,323
How do we get them to 2167?

89
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,967
- That's what the magnet is for.
- It's used as a launch platform.

90
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,245
It will hold the cylinder at the precise axis
it needs to be to enter the wormhole...

91
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,364
...ensuring that the cylinder
reaches its destination.

92
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,087
And the scrolls are to help us
set those cylinders precisely.

93
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,568
We'll need two generators
to power the magnet.

94
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,807
Already with Anil.

95
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,402
To run the magnet off two generators,
they have to be in perfect phase.

96
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,365
- We'll need a synchroscope.
- I would have thought of that.

97
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,565
There would be one of them in there,
probably near the fish tank.

98
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,765
And Michael?

99
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,448
He will traverse the Wormhole to 2167.

100
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,486
He'll meet the scientist in Oslo, Norway.

101
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,809
And that meeting will change
the course of human evolution.

102
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,886
How will he know who the scientist is?

103
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,522
There will be someone there to guide him.

104
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,327
It's Broyles.

105
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,927
You good?

106
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,963
I'm leaving for Boston.
Coming to you.

107
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,530
Have him on the Spring Street exit.
Number 49 northbound, lane two.

108
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,370
Copy, traffic control.

109
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,927
Bravo unit is on standby
to continue surveillance.

110
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,811
Bravo unit has visual.
He's 200 meters ahead, right lane.

111
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,731
Copy that.
- Call us when you're close.

112
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,605
Peter will meet you
at the entrance of the steam tunnel.

113
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,686
Broyles, are you there?

114
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,046
Can you hear me?

115
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,486
Hello ?

116
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,247
They're following me.
Windmark is letting me lead them to you.

117
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,922
I'll lead them around as long as I can.

118
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,080
But it's only a matter of time before
they realize I'm not leading them to you.

119
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,682
If I'm caught, they'll read me.

120
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,645
I can protect my thoughts,
but there's only so long that will last.

121
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,003
Windmark is not going to read you.
We're going to come and get you.

122
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,969
The most important thing is the plan.

123
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,407
Listen to me, Phillip,
tell me where you are.

124
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,889
Olivia...

125
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,321
-...just get it done.
- Just tell me where--

126
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,287
You heard him. If he is captured, it's only a
matter of time before they know we're here.

127
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,603
Peter. Start excavating that synchroscope.

128
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,928
We need to go get the new initiator.

129
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,250
And we need to gather everything that is
required and leave. It's our only chance.

130
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,808
Peter, how you going
with the synchroscope?

131
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,601
No synchroscope yet,
but I found some sort of syringe.

132
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,686
Any idea what that was for
or why you had it?

133
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,809
I have no idea.

134
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,650
This tape is addressed to me.

135
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,483
It's your handwriting.

136
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,287
Peter, I sent you a letter.

137
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,006
It contains something of mine.

138
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,287
What letter, Walter?

139
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,451
I imagine you called me to ask, "Why would
you send such a strange letter?"

140
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,450
And when you tried to call, I didn't answer...

141
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,768
...so you came to find me at the lab.

142
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,446
But I was not to be found.

143
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,363
I was here one moment, then vanished
from the face of the Earth the next.

144
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,003
I want you to know, I'm fine.

145
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,288
Living many, many years from now.

146
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,329
What is this, Walter?

147
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,682
You will never see me again.

148
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,409
You will never see me again...

149
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,050
...because it had to be this way
to ensure the future of our humanity.

150
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,043
Your future.

151
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,006
The future of Olivia and the future of Etta.

152
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:08,047
I don't want you to be sad.
The time we had together, we stole.

153
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,566
I cheated fate to be with you.

154
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,283
And we shouldn't have had
that time together, but we did.

155
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,242
<i>And I wouldn't change it for the world</i>

156
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,241
I don't want to say goodbye...

157
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,083
...but I will say...

158
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,046
...I love you, son.

159
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,965
I wasn't truthful with you.
I do know what that is.

160
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,242
It's an inoculation for time travel.

161
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,561
I'm taking the child Observer
into the future, Peter.

162
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,126
I was already inoculated in 2015.

163
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,570
I left this one in case
something happened to me...

164
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,321
...and someone else had to bring the boy
across to complete the plan.

165
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,843
- Does it have to be this way?
- Yes.

166
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,284
Why?

167
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:34,001
Because, Peter, the boy and I,
we will become a paradox.

168
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,883
Nature abhors a paradox.

169
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,481
It has to heal itself.

170
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,647
It does so by deleting me and the boy
at the moment of the invasion.

171
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,882
The boy and I will disappear after 2015.

172
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,327
So in order to maintain a future
without the Observers...

173
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,327
...you and Michael have to live out
the rest of your lives in the future.

174
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,126
I know in my soul
this is what I am supposed to do.

175
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,209
I want you to give Olivia
your daughter back.

176
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,568
I want to give you your life back.

177
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,203
As a father, how could I not do that for you?

178
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,962
What I said in the tape
about stealing time with you, I meant it.

179
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,205
I wouldn't trade it for the world.

180
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,210
You are my favorite thing, Peter.

181
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,564
My very favorite thing.

182
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,447
- Left it in the car?
- No, I didn't.

183
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,001
Hang on a second.

184
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,804
What happened to the part?

185
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,771
This was taken from one of
the original 12 scientific expedition team.

186
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,529
Your order to monitor
the remaining members was wise.

187
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,808
When December traveled to the future
and procured this unit, I was notified.

188
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,205
What is this?

189
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,007
September is assembling a device
with the fugitives.

190
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,851
It is a trigger containing an atomic charge...

191
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,884
...that is going to allow them
to create a Wormhole.

192
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,004
They intend to reset time.

193
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,928
He's in the number 6 stairwell. B Unit, cover
61st Street exit, subject's moving on foot.

194
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,407
Repeat, he's in the number 6 stairwell.

195
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,085
He knows that we know.

196
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,484
We can't complete the plan
because we're missing one single piece?

197
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,843
Without the initiating reactor,
there's no way we can open a Wormhole.

198
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,163
- There's not enough energy.
- The rocks provide the energy.

199
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,207
- To sustain the reaction, not to trigger it.
- Like a car with a full tank and no spark plug.

200
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,606
We're stuck.

201
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,050
There must be someplace we can find
another ignition source.

202
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,084
- Maybe we can make one.
- It's impossible.

203
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,760
Nothing strong enough
available in this time period.

204
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,610
Michael, I need your help.

205
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,647
When I crossed over to rescue you,
you looked at me like you expected me.

206
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,161
You smiled.
Like you knew I'd come for you.

207
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,205
Can you tell me what I should do next?

208
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,250
What about a shipping lane?

209
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,726
Of course. If we could gain
control of a shipping lane...

210
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,127
...we could use that as our Wormhole!

211
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,488
And everything else
would work as planned.

212
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,285
You are a genius!

213
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,971
This is the shipping manifest I decoded.

214
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,209
It's a schedule. It'll give us the location
and time of the next shipment.

215
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,449
- So when is it opening?
- Tomorrow morning at 6:08 a.m.

216
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,771
40.7787 north.
73.9776 west.

217
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,804
- That's New York.
- See what you can find about checkpoints.

218
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,843
First we need an end dock stabilizer.

219
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,242
What is an end dock stabilizer?

220
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,720
It looks like a cube.

221
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,400
You activate it at the location
the wormhole opens.

222
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,726
I know what you mean.

223
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,321
If we re-calibrate it,
we can reverse the polarity.

224
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,842
Change directional flow of the shipping lane
so that it'll send rather than receive.

225
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,002
- Anil?
- Broyles. He's been captured.

226
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,524
I put out feelers. I'll keep you informed.
What does this mean for the plan?

227
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,204
It's happening tomorrow morning.

228
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,209
There's one other thing we need first.

229
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,847
Peter. Hold onto these tight.

230
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,281
Anti-gravity osmium bullets.

231
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,769
Shoot Observers with these
and watch them float away like balloons.

232
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,009
We shoot them, they're dead.
Why do we want them to float away?

233
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,084
Because it's cool.

234
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,089
That makes sense, Walter.

235
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,243
Okay. Let's start loading the car.

236
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,921
You gonna be okay?

237
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,283
Walter, there's something
I want to show you.

238
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,440
Peter...

239
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,608
...I want to talk to you.

240
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,847
Gene.

241
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,284
I was gonna let her out, but I was afraid
that they would hear her moo.

242
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,884
Yes, she does moo quite loudly.

243
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,205
Especially after a meal.

244
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,167
I at least wanted you to see her.

245
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,166
You always know how to soothe me.

246
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,163
You always have.

247
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,767
Walter, this is not the end.

248
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,002
We're gonna win this.

249
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,607
And when we do, we'll be...

250
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,647
...drinking strawberry milkshakes
in the lab...

251
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,810
...and we're not even gonna remember
that this happened.

252
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,331
That sounds lovely.

253
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,206
It's a beautiful name.

254
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,964
What is?

255
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,129
Astrid.

256
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,329
Before we arrived here...

257
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,850
...we sent a team of 12.

258
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,204
Their mission was to observe and report

259
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,245
However...

260
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,290
...a strange phenomenon occurred.

261
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,289
To some degree or other...

262
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,404
...they succumbed to irrational emotion.

263
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,530
Your kind infected them.

264
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,449
But not you.

265
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,243
You seem to be impervious to everything.

266
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,924
I will never speak of it again...

267
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,763
...but I will admit this to you, Philip.

268
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,967
I, too, feel something.

269
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,130
I believe you call it...

270
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,924
...hate.

271
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,971
The feeling is mutual.

272
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,404
- I didn't know about it...
- Why didn't you tell us not to...?

273
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,489
I can handle...

274
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,561
What?

275
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,241
Remember when I told you we had
a long way to go before seeing her again?

276
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,411
It's not that long anymore.

277
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,809
We're going to see her.

278
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,723
We're gonna have her back.

279
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,602
Nothing else matters.

280
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,006
He's here.

281
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,804
Hey.
- Hi.

282
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,163
This is an air intake supply line.

283
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,331
- It leads to half the building.
- That's enough, believe me.

284
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,726
Good luck.

285
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,330
We need to get going.
We have to meet them.

286
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,770
I gave myself the last inoculation.

287
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,329
I'm going with him, Walter.

288
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,045
I'm taking him into the future.

289
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,601
I've already told Peter about my decision.

290
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,564
I know you once believed
this was your destiny...

291
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,125
...a price you had to pay.

292
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,249
I need this.

293
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,091
I have prepared myself for this.

294
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,648
I've been thinking about this
since I first saw the boy again.

295
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,969
Walter, 20 years ago, when I agreed
to let you be the one to take him...

296
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,845
...I didn't have the feelings I have now.

297
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,285
Later, when I began to realize
the height of his intellect...

298
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,001
...and what you call
the depths of his emotions...

299
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,486
...still...

300
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,888
...I couldn't understand what it was
that I meant to him.

301
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,050
And I was unable to reciprocate.

302
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,002
When I saw you...

303
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,003
...when I saw Peter...

304
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,845
...and saw what he meant to you...

305
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,246
...then I understood what my feelings were...

306
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,848
...and why they were important.

307
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,365
I can't communicate with him
in the traditional ways...

308
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,367
...but when I take his hand...

309
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,962
...and I lead him...

310
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,647
...he'll know that I love him.

311
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,602
That's being a father.

312
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,969
It's not about fate, Walter, yours or mine.

313
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,646
It's about changing fate.

314
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,082
It is about hope.

315
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,650
And protecting our children.

316
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,400
Think about them, Phillip.

317
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,569
Think about where they are.

318
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,841
They will understand you had no choice.

319
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,844
It is acceptable.

320
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,927
I am your ally.

321
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,169
<i>Harvard University.</i>

322
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,807
--In the lab...
--in the lab...

323
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,927
Clear the building.

324
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,245
Let's go, let's go.

325
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,201
It is entering this wing. Evacuate.

326
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,521
Oh, my God! No!

327
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,281
- I found one.
- Good, because I found something too.

328
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,765
We'll get you out of here.

329
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,567
You don't know how lucky you are
this room has no ventilation.

330
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,444
Trust me.

331
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,330
They'll set up the corridor soon.
We don't have much time.

332
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,927
Where are Peter and Olivia?

333
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,720
Olivia, where are you?

334
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,404
They've got the cube.

335
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,089
And Agent Broyles.

336
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,851
- I know. We're in position.
- We have to hurry.

337
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,204
Team 2. Engage.

338
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,250
- Move, move, move!
- Regroup!

339
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,920
Michael. Stay down.

340
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,125
Peter! Peter, look!

341
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,609
What did I say? That is cool! Ha-ha-ha!

342
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,731
Now, Walter!

343
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,481
Get the boy!

344
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,566
Let's go.

345
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,962
I love you, Dad.

346
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,527
I think that I would be happy
to stay here...

347
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,643
...for the rest of my life.

348
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,088
We should probably get her home, soon.

349
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,409
Get her into a bath,
which is never easy.

350
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,928
I nominate you for that one. Etta!

351
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,603
It's time to go.

352
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,122
Come on, kiddo.
It's time to go home.

353
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,202
You're being silly.
