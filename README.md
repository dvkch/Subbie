## Disclaimer

I made this project in a weekend to help a friend, I cannnot and will not guarantee I will have any more time to spend on it now that it reached v1.0. 

You may open an issue for improvments, but keep in mind this is meant as a small tool to quickly create and sync SRT files and I would like to keep the list of features as small as possible.

Of course, feel free to report any bugs, with a reproducible example if possible, and I'll do my best to link into it.
